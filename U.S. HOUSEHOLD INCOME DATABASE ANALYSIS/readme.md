# üè† U.S. Household Income ‚Äî Data Cleaning & SQL Analysis

## üìò Project Overview
This SQL project focuses on **data cleaning, validation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** for two datasets:

- `USHouseholdIncome`
- `USHouseholdIncome_Statistics`

The goal is to ensure data quality, remove duplicates, fix inconsistent values, and extract insights about **income distribution, land/water area, and household income** across U.S. states and cities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps & Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Inspection
```sql
SELECT * FROM USHouseholdIncome;
SELECT * FROM USHouseholdIncome_Statistics;
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM USHouseholdIncome;
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM USHouseholdIncome_Statistics;
```
‚úîÔ∏è Verified dataset structure and record counts for both tables.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Duplicate Removal
```sql
SELECT id, COUNT(id)
FROM USHouseholdIncome
GROUP BY id
HAVING COUNT(id) > 1;

DELETE FROM USHouseholdIncome
WHERE row_id IN (
  SELECT row_id
  FROM (
    SELECT row_id, id,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY id) AS row_num
    FROM USHouseholdIncome
  ) duplicates
  WHERE row_num > 1
);
```

üßπ Removed duplicate records using the ROW_NUMBER() window function.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Standardization
```sql
UPDATE USHouseholdIncome
SET State_Name = 'Georgia'
WHERE State_Name = 'georia';

UPDATE USHouseholdIncome
SET State_Name = 'Alabama'
WHERE State_Name = 'alabama';
```

üî§ Fixed inconsistent spellings and standardized text values.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Values
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM USHouseholdIncome
WHERE Place IS NULL
ORDER BY 1;

UPDATE USHouseholdIncome
SET Place = 'Autaugaville'
WHERE Place IS NULL;
```

üíæ Filled missing Place entries to ensure data completeness.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Validation
```sql
SELECT ALand, AWater
FROM USHouseholdIncome
WHERE (TRY_CAST(AWater AS BIGINT) IS NULL OR TRY_CAST(AWater AS BIGINT) = 0)
  AND (ALand IS NULL OR TRY_CAST(ALand AS BIGINT) = 0);
```

üß™ Validated numeric integrity of ALand and AWater fields.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregation & Insights
üîπ Total Land and Water Area by State
```sql
SELECT State_Name,
       SUM(TRY_CAST(ALand AS BIGINT)) AS TotalLand_In_State,
       SUM(TRY_CAST(AWater AS BIGINT)) AS Total_WaterA_In_State
FROM USHouseholdIncome
GROUP BY State_Name
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
üîπ Top 10 States by Average Income
```sql
SELECT TOP 10 u.State_Name,
       ROUND(AVG(Mean),1) AS avg_mean_income,
       ROUND(AVG(Median),1) AS avg_median_income
FROM USHouseholdIncome u
JOIN USHouseholdIncome_Statistics u_s
ON u.id = u_s.id
WHERE Mean <> 0
GROUP BY u.State_Name
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

üîπ Income by Type & City
```sql
SELECT TOP 30 u.State_Name, City,
       ROUND(AVG(Mean),1) AS avg_mean_income,
       ROUND(AVG(Median),1) AS avg_median_income
FROM USHouseholdIncome u
JOIN USHouseholdIncome_Statistics u_s
ON u.id = u_s.id
WHERE Mean <> 0
GROUP BY City, u.State_Name
ORDER BY avg_mean_income DESC;
```

üìä Derived insights on income variations across states, city types, and regions.

üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Summary

| Table                        | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| USHouseholdIncome            | Contains demographic and geographic information (state, city, land area, water area, type, etc.) |
| USHouseholdIncome_Statistics | Includes household income metrics (mean and median income per area ID)                           |
